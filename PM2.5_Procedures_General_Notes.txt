This is an outline for the PM2.5 regressions. Everything
up to the last paragraph is preprocessing. Most operations
are R scripts.

PREPROCESS

Data sources used:
EPA (PM2.5 and other)
Aeronet
MODIS MAIAC
RAP
Campaign data, if applicable

For use in outputs: surface elevation, coastlines, and other
geography.

Define regions of interest, and short identifier for each:
Eg "SJV" == "San Joaquin Valley". 

Download data and preprocess.
Standardize names

Use ESMF software to preprocess coefficients for grid interpolations.

The basic data used in regressions are based on MODIS overpass times
and ground site locations.
Ground site and model data is extracted at the closest time, within
2 hrs, to the overpass,

Spatial data is extracted at the ground site locations and within
2 hrs of overpass time.

NOTE: the hdf (hdf4) functions are a local package and are not
publically available. The same applies to the streamline
calculations which are sometimes done.

Extract data within the regions. Save as compressed binary files,
per region, for fast reading into R.
Structure is a 3d array with dimension time, variable, and ground site.
Data from each source (eg, EPA) is extracted individually; these
arrays are then merged into one.

REGRESS

Define regression models and run regressions and produce results
(plots and text). It is usually necessary to edit the scripts
to deal with special circumstances.
